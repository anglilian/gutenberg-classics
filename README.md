# gutenberg-classics
Exploration of web scraping and textual analysis using the Harvard Classics.

# What was I trying to accomplish?
I was reading 'Writing Tools - 55 Essential Strategies for Every Writer' and wondered to what extent writers of classic English texts applied these tools. Two of the tools I tested related to sentence length and verb tenses. For this exploration, I scraped text from 129 books on Gutenberg (which I belated realised is not encouraged and allowed). Nevertheless, the code used to web scrape, analyse and visualise my initial findings might be useful to others! I offer it here with code comments and an open invitation to drop me a message should anything be unclear or if you have any suggestions for improvement.
